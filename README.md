# IMU_Stim_demo
A collection of demos with stimulation controlled by IMUs

You need stimulator.py from https://github.com/lara-unb/Py_stimulator
It's already included in the project, but you can also get the IMU api from https://github.com/lara-unb/YEI_3-Space_Python_API_2.0.2.3_Src_19Jun2014

Run one_channel.py to control one channel of stimulation with one IMU. Follow instructions on terminal to adjust current. 
Same thing with two_channel.py

Be careful.
Good luck!
